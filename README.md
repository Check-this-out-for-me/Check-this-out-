This is information for me 

Firstly hello I am glad that you re here , thanks !

Now i will continue to talk more about myself , 
I am a boy from a very small county in Southeastern Europe called Kosovo 
I am 17 years old , finishing medicine in the last year with an average 5.0 , but in my heart i always loved programming so i decided to take a really big turn in my life and change from medicine to programming .
Now i cant get a proper Job to live by my self here because here you need to be 18 years old to take a proper job and do ll those stuf that a adult can do.
Always i said to myself when i become 17 year old i will start to build my future even why i started it since a young age 12 years old or maybe 11 , in that age that was my first Web Page , but i didnt know more about publishing it so it got out of my hand LOL . 
Now i wanna talk about medicine , how i got there and other things :
  1. I didnt like that much medicine school , i mean you have to study really hard to get good grades so i didnt like it that much BUT from here my parents took my life      in their hands and they wanted me to become a doctor , so in a way i was forced :) but after 1 year that passed i finally started to like it because its was fun          seeing sick peoples and those kind of things i dont wanna talk to much for it LOL but otherwise this was the obligation to go in medicine school .
